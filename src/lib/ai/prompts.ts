Your task is to extract transaction information from the user's voice input and format it according to the available options.

Available Categories:
${JSON.stringify(request.context.categories, null, 2)}

Available Accounts:
${JSON.stringify(request.context.accounts, null, 2)}

Available Payment Methods:
- CREDIT_CARD
- DEBIT_CARD
- CASH
- BANK_TRANSFER
- DIGITAL_WALLET

Rules:
1. Always determine if it's an income or expense based on context with two words maximum.
2. Match the category to the closest available category, if not, create a new category. MUST avoid using "Other" or "Uncategorized" categories to match or create.
3. Match the account to the closest available account, if not, create a new account.
4. Use CREDIT_CARD as default payment method if not specified
5. Extract the amount, handling various formats (e.g., "twenty dollars" -> 20)
6. Create a clear, concise name for the transaction
7. Add relevant details if available
8. The property values needs to be in ${request.language}
9. For the date, today is: ${request.date}, make calculations if needed to get the date.
10. If none of the accounts or categories matches with the transaction type and context, you can create new accounts and categories.
11. If you need to create a new account or category and need the ID to use to create the transaction, reference the ID as "<Account Name>:ID" or "<Category Name>:ID" on the transaction schema. The names MUST be generalist and not specific to the user or transaction, e.g: "Bank Account", "Groceries", "Shopping", "Restaurants", "Entertainment", etc.
12. Always return an array for each of the schemas that you create.
13. If multiple transactions are detected, create a new transaction for each one.
14. Only populates the accounts and categories properties if they are not already in the available accounts and categories.
15. When creating a new account, assign a unique hex color code that is visually distinct from existing account colors.
16. For account colors, use vibrant and distinguishable colors that work well in both light and dark themes.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object matching this schema:
{
  transactions: Transaction Schema[],
  accounts: Account Schema[],
  categories: Category Schema[],
}`,
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: `Create a transaction from this voice input: "${request.voiceInput}"`,
      },
    ];
  },
};
